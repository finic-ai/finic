Rules enforcing best practices and consistency using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

While you can use the official plugin [`prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss) for ordering your classnames...

**`eslint-plugin-tailwindcss` offers more than 5 other rules, that you can benefit from on top of `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`. Sounds good ? Keep reading 👇**

## **🎉 Compatible with Tailwind CSS v3 and v2 🎉**

## Make sure to use the correct version

- Still using Tailwind CSS v2 ? 👻
  - You should stick with `v2.x.x` of this plugin (`npm i eslint-plugin-tailwindcss@tw2`)
- Using Tailwind CSS v3 ? 🚀
  - Make sure to use `v3.x.x` of this plugin (`npm i eslint-plugin-tailwindcss`

**If you are using the eslint extension, make sure to restart VSCode in order to use the lastest version of the plugin and not the former version from the cache.**

- FIX: [speeds up `enforces-shorthand` and `classnames-order`](https://github.com/francoismassart/eslint-plugin-tailwindcss/issues/136) with `officialSorting: true` by introducing WeakMap caches to reduce duplicate calculations (by [mpsijm](https://github.com/mpsijm) 🙏)
- New strategy for whitespaces and linebreaks: the plugin will attempt to leave them intact
- New option `officialSorting` for [`classnames-order`](docs/rules/classnames-order.md#officialsorting-default-false) can be set to `true` in order to use the same ordering order as the official [`prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss)
- FIX: `enforces-shorthand` rule [fixer](https://github.com/francoismassart/eslint-plugin-tailwindcss/issues/120) and [fix prefix](https://github.com/francoismassart/eslint-plugin-tailwindcss/issues/121)
- FIX: [`enforces-shorthand` rule loses the importance flag](https://github.com/francoismassart/eslint-plugin-tailwindcss/issues/114)
- New rule: [`enforces-negative-arbitrary-values`](docs/rules/enforces-negative-arbitrary-values.md): prefers `top-[-5px]` instead of `-top-[5px]`
- FIX: [allowing negative arbitrary values in dash prefixed classnames](https://github.com/francoismassart/eslint-plugin-tailwindcss/issues/112)
- FIX: deprecated message for `ring-opacity-*` in `migration-from-tailwind-2` rule

## Supported Rules

Learn more about each supported rules by reading their documentation:

- [`classnames-order`](docs/rules/classnames-order.md): order classnames by target properties then by variants (`[size:][theme:][state:]`)
- [`enforces-negative-arbitrary-values`](docs/rules/enforces-negative-arbitrary-values.md): make sure to use negative arbitrary values classname without the negative classname e.g. `-top-[5px]` should become `top-[-5px]`
- [`enforces-shorthand`](docs/rules/enforces-shorthand.md): merge multiple classnames into shorthand if possible e.g. `mx-5 my-5` should become `m-5`
- [`migration-from-tailwind-2`](docs/rules/migration-from-tailwind-2.md) for easy upgrade from Tailwind CSS `v2` to `v3`.
  Warning: at the moment you should [temporary turn off the `no-custom-classname`](https://github.com/francoismassart/eslint-plugin-tailwindcss/issues/88) rule if you want to see the warning from `migration-from-tailwind-2`
- [`no-arbitrary-value`](docs/rules/no-arbitrary-value.md): forbid using arbitrary values in classnames (turned off by default)
- [`no-custom-classname`](docs/rules/no-custom-classname.md): only allow classnames from Tailwind CSS and the values from the `whitelist` option
- [`no-contradicting-classname`](docs/rules/no-contradicting-classname.md): e.g. avoid `p-2 p-3`, different Tailwind CSS classnames (`pt-2` & `pt-3`) but targeting the same property several times for the same variant.

Using ESLint extension for Visual Studio Code, you will get these messages

You can can the same information on your favorite command line software as well.

## Installation

You'll first need to install [ESLint](http://eslint.org):

```
$ npm i -D eslint
```

Next, install the latest version of `eslint-plugin-tailwindcss` if you are using Tailwind CSS v3

```
$ npm i -D eslint-plugin-tailwindcss
```

> ### Still using Tailwind CSS v2?
>
> 👉 Install the latest version compatible with Tailwind CSS v2 via `npm i -D eslint-plugin-tailwindcss@tw2`
>
> Please note that new rules might not be available in the `tw2` distribution

Add `tailwindcss` to the plugins section of your `.eslintrc` configuration file. You can omit the `eslint-plugin-` prefix:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["tailwindcss"]
}
```

## Configuration

Use our preset to get reasonable defaults:

```
  "extends": [
    "plugin:tailwindcss/recommended"
  ]
```

If you do not use a preset you will need to specify individual rules and add extra configuration:

Configure the rules you want to use under the rules section.

> The following lines are matching the configuration saved in the `recommended` preset...

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "tailwindcss/classnames-order": "warn",
    "tailwindcss/enforces-negative-arbitrary-values": "warn",
    "tailwindcss/enforces-shorthand": "warn",
    "tailwindcss/migration-from-tailwind-2": "warn",
    "tailwindcss/no-arbitrary-value": "off",
    "tailwindcss/no-custom-classname": "warn",
    "tailwindcss/no-contradicting-classname": "error"
  }
}
```

Learn more about [Configuring Rules in ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/rules).

## Optional shared settings

Most rules shares the same settings, instead of duplicating some options...

You should also specify settings that will be shared across all the plugin rules.
[More about eslint shared settings](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#adding-shared-settings).

All these settings have nice default values that are explained in each rules' documentation. I'm listing them in the code below just to show them.

```json5
{
  settings: {
    tailwindcss: {
      // These are the default values but feel free to customize
      callees: ["classnames", "clsx", "ctl"],
      config: "tailwind.config.js",
      cssFiles: [
        "**/*.css",
        "!**/node_modules",
        "!**/.*",
        "!**/dist",
        "!**/build",
      ],
      cssFilesRefreshRate: 5_000,
      removeDuplicates: true,
      whitelist: [],
    },
  },
}
```

The plugin will look for each setting value in this order and stop looking as soon as it finds the settings:

1. In the rule option argument (rule level)
2. In the shared settings (plugin level)
3. Default value of the requested setting (plugin level)...

## Upcoming Rules

- `validate-modifiers`: I don't know if possible, but I'd like to make sure all the modifiers prefixes of a classname are valid e.g. `yolo:bg-red` should throw an error...

- `no-redundant-variant`: e.g. avoid `mx-5 sm:mx-5`, no need to redefine `mx` in `sm:` variant as it uses the same value (`5`)

- `only-valid-arbitrary-values`:
  - e.g. avoid `top-[42]`, only `0` value can be unitless.
  - e.g. avoid `text-[rgba(10%,20%,30,50%)]`, can't mix `%` and `0-255`.

## Alternatives

I wrote this plugin after searching for existing tools which perform the same task but didn't satisfied my needs:

- [prettier-plugin-tailwindcss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss), the official plugin, only takes care of ordering classnames, do not support array of classnames, do not support blade
- [eslint-plugin-tailwind](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-tailwind), not bad but no support (yet) for variants sorting
- [Headwind](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=heybourn.headwind), only works within Visual Studio Code
