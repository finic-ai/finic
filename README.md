[Finic](https://finic.ai/) is a cloud platform designed to simplify the deployment and management of browser-based automation agents, with a focus on fault-tolerant execution. Itâ€™s designed for quickly launching bots, scrapers, RPA integrationsm and other jobs that depend on multiple authenticated web services. 

Finic is designed to be **unopionated about the development process**, and simply provide network-level utilities and infrastructure to help you make your agents reliable and scalable.

Currently, [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python) is supported for interacting with DOM elements and [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) is recommended (though not required) for parsing HTML.

## Features:
* **Cloud Deployment:** Deploy a pre-configured Playwright container to Finic Cloud with a single command. Trigger agents from the Finic dashboard or API.
* **Secure Credential Management:** Safely store and access credentials using Finicâ€™s built-in secret manager.
* **Monitoring:** Track agent execution and view detailed logs through the Finic dashboard.


## Quickstart
Install Finic.
```bash
pip install finicapi
```

Create a new agent with boilerplate code that logs into a website and extracts HTML content.
```bash
create-finic-app example-project
cd example-project
```

Run your agent locally.
```bash
poetry install
poetry run start
```

Deploy your agent to Finic Cloud.
```bash
finic-deploy
```

View and run your agent from the [Finic dashboard](https://app.finic.io/agents).

## ðŸš§ Roadmap
* Automated deployment from GitHub.
* Containers with X11 installed for advanced UI automation.
* Session impersonation - sync session tokens to the secret manager so your agents can use them.
* Self healing selectors - use LLMs to propose code fixes when the content changes on target websites.
* Scheduling and orchestration features to define workflows composed of multiple agents.
* Automatically detect rate limits and back off to maximize throughput.
* Set custom timeouts with no upper bound, useful for long running tasks or always-on agents.
