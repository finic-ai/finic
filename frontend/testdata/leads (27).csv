patrick@patchedreality.com,Federico Barrera,Federico,Barrera,Founder and Chief Developer,https://www.linkedin.com/in/federico-barrera-970743a2,Patched Reality,https://www.patchedreality.com,"Hi Federico,

I've been really impressed by the work you've done at Patched Reality, especially your focus on spatial computing technologies and your successful collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History. Your dedication to transparency and responsiveness to feedback is something that really stands out.

My name is Jason and I'm the founder and CEO at Dealwise, a startup that helps investors identify attractive businesses looking to sell. The reason I'm emailing is because I was hoping you'd be open to a conversation with one of my clients. He's looking for a company that has a strong focus on technology and innovation, and has a proven track record of working within technical and budget constraints. If you are open to an exit, I thought Patched Reality would be a good fit.

The buyer is backed by private capital so he can move fast, but unlike PE firms his goal is to take over as CEO and continue to grow the business.

Let me know if you'd have time to chat with both of us in the next week, we can be flexible.","

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I recently came across your practice and I wanted to introduce you to Revival Health, a company that specializes in automating repetitive and manual tasks in healthcare practices.

At Revival Health, we understand that one of the biggest challenges in healthcare is the burden of administrative tasks, such as eligibility, claims entry, payment reconciliation, and more. Our goal is to help practices like yours eliminate these burdensome tasks and save time by automating them.

We offer a range of automation solutions, including eligibility and authorization automation, finding coverage not known to you or your patients, and building custom automations tailored to your practice's specific needs. Our virtual worker, RevBot, is trained to take on tedious and repetitive tasks, working 24/7 and delivering results 3-5 times faster than a human being.

With Revival Health automation, you can focus more on delivering top-quality care to your patients and less on administrative tasks. Plus, we guarantee a full return on investment in just one year from the day we go live, or we credit you the difference.

I would love to learn more about your practice, your goals, and the technology challenges you're facing. Let's schedule a call to discuss how Revival Health can help streamline your practice and improve efficiency.

I've been really impressed with what you've built at Toolkit3D. Your team, especially Olivier Bisson, seems to be doing some innovative work in custom solutions. It's not every day you come across a company that's so dedicated to using toolkit technology to solve complex problems.

My name is Jason and I'm the founder and CEO at Dealwise, a startup that helps investors identify attractive businesses looking to sell. The reason I'm emailing is because I was hoping you'd be open to a conversation with one of my clients. He's looking for a company that has a strong team, a unique product, and is based in Seattle. If you are open to an exit, I thought Toolkit3D would be a good fit.

The buyer is backed by private capital so he can move fast, but unlike PE firms his goal is to take over as CEO and continue to grow the business.

Let me know if you'd have time to chat with both of us in the next week, we can be flexible.","
